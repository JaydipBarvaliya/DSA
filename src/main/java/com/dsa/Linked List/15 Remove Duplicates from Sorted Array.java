// There is a one confusion which can arise that why we are keeping the NND to the 1 from ///starting ....even if that is the case then why we are doing NND-1 in to the if condition.
// The reason is that, whenever we are finding the next non duplicate number we are taking the value of that variable and then replacing it to the the position where NND positioning...which means we are finding unique elem and pushing them to the front of the list...By doing this we also need take care of the comparision as well .....so in that case ...curr and NND-1 variable help us to do that....so NND has two use cases ....first to hold the replacement position and second is to hold the comparision element
